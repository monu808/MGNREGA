## Recording Script (Timeline: 1:50)

### Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)
**What to show:** Your face + project homepage

**Actions:**
- Quick glimpse of complex data.gov.in interface
- Switch to your clean interface
- Show "Auto-detect location" button

---

### Scene 3: Key Features Demo (0:35 - 1:10)
**What to show:** Live application with all features

**Script:**
> "Watch this - it automatically detects your location and finds your district. Notice the visual design: green checkmark for excellent, yellow for average, red for needs improvement. Even low-literacy users understand instantly. It's bilingual - toggle to Hindi with one click. Users can listen to summaries with text-to-speech. View 12 months of history with charts, and compare multiple districts."

**Actions:**
- Click "Auto-detect location" (0:35-0:40)
- Browser asks for permission ‚Üí Allow

If their API is down, we serve from local cache - ensuring reliability. React frontend with Chart.js visualizations. Everything's Dockerized for easy deployment."

**Actions:**
- Show VS Code with project structure (1:10-1:15)
  ```
  MGNREGA/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
